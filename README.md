# Colour-Box.Type
A typing game for beginners and pros made with Ruby2D.

NOTE 1: WILL WORK ONLY ON LINUX. I DON'T HAVE WINDOWS OR MAC TO TEST IT. I WOULD SUGGEST A KIND PERSON TO GIVE ME SOME SUGGESTIONS. NOTE 2: THE FILE HAS NO RESCUE BLOCK, THUS WILL RAISE LoadError IF YOU DON'T HAVE RUBY 2D NOTE 3: YOU CAN GO TO http://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/ FOR RUBY2D INSTALLATION GUIDE.

This is a simple typing game with a nice UI and all cool features made with Ruby2D! Clone the file. Download the Zip, and run the main.rb with ruby or directly. Run it! You are good to go! Have fun, and you may read/modify/redistribute the code, currently no restriction comes in!
